    <h1>Welcome to My Cool Webpage</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm excited to be learning HTML and building my very first webpage. It's been an amazing journey so far!</p>
    <p>I enjoy designing clean, semantic pages and learning how to style and structure them properly.</p>

    <h3>My Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>Over the next few weeks, I plan to improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I want to build responsive, interactive websites and maybe even launch a portfolio!</p>
